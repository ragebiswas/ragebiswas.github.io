      <description>Hello So I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to revive my blog in a while, and instead of trying to bring up the old version (based on Ghost), I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to give Hugo a shot since static site generators are so well suited for occasional bloggers such as me, who post once in a decade or so.
This post is meant to try out basic formatting of the Ananke theme.
Markdown As a programmer, Markdown is what I prefer for blog posts and it&amp;rsquo;s delightful that Hugo supports this out of the box and is fairly optimized for this.</description>
